                <li>A typing test measures how fast and accurately you can type, usually shown as words per minute (WPM)
                    and an accuracy percentage.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="questions">
                Q. What does WPM mean?
                <button class="toggle-button">+</button>
            </div>
            <ul class="answers">
                <li>WPM stands for Words Per Minute, which is the number of words you can type in one minute. Each word
                    is counted as five keystrokes.</li>
            </ul>

                Q. How do I start a typing contest?

            </div>
            <ul class="answers">
                <li>Simply select the test duration (30 secs, 1 min, or 2 mins) and the Difficulty Level and click the
                    "Start Contest" button.</li>

                Q. How does the leaderboard work?
                <button class="toggle-button">+</button>
            </div>
            <ul class="answers">
                <li>The leaderboard works by collecting data from users' typing contests, such as their speed (WPM),
                    accuracy, and difficulty level. This data is then ranked to show the top performers globally or by
                    city. The ranking is updated dynamically based on each user's performance, so you can see how you
                    compare to others in real-time.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="questions">
                Q. What happens if I make mistakes during the competition?
                <button class="toggle-button">+</button>
            </div>
            <ul class="answers">
                <li>If you make mistakes during the competition, your accuracy score will decrease. The system will
                    highlight incorrect or missed words in the mistake analysis report after the contest, helping you
                    learn and improve for the next challenge!</li>

                Q. How do I earn badges?
                <button class="toggle-button">+</button>
            </div>
            <ul class="answers">
                <li>You can level up or earn badges by performing well in typing contests. For example, achieving high
                    speed (WPM), maintaining excellent accuracy, or balancing both will unlock badges like "Blazing
                    Typist", "Accuracy Ace", or "Perfect Combo". Consistent participation and improving your stats help
                    you level up!</li>
